  DaVinci Ergonomics Laboratory is a startup that aims to build the next generation of ergonomic keyboards.

  I started this because I was so annoyed by the high price of ergonomic keyboards, and the lack of innovation in the space.

  The keyboard is designed to be extremely customizable, and the firmware is open source (QMK/VIA).
