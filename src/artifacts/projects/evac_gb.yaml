    GreenEVT is a city-scale evacuation simulator with a focus on high-dimensional constraints and objectives - not just city traffic, but also load on the power grid due to charging electric vehicles.
    
    I was tasked to maintain the codebase for the hybrid simulator, and optimize its performance (resulted in 5x speedup).

    Implemented in Python with a SQLite database, backed by integrations with SUMO and OpenDSS.
