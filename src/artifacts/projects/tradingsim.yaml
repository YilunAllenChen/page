  TradingSim is a trading simulator that allows players to trade against each other and bots in a simulated market. Market impact of orders are materialized and reflected in the price of the security in real time. 

  The simulator ships with both a web interface and RESTful API's.

  Built with Python (backend), Javascript with Bootstrap (frontend) (I got lazy)
