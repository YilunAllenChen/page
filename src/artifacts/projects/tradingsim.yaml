  TradingSim is a trading simulator that allows players to trade against each other and bots in a simulated market. Market impact of orders are materialized and reflected in real time.

  The simulator, backed by a FIFO matching engine, ships with both a web interface and RESTful API's.

  Built with Python (backend), Javascript with Bootstrap (frontend) (I got lazy)
